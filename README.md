# React Flow App

A React-based application that provides an intuitive UI for creating and managing connections between various elements (nodes). The application allows users to connect different types of boxes, such as Input, Output, JSON, Gmail, etc., and visualize the flow of data between them. For example, connecting an Input box to an Output box will display the input data in the Output box.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop UI:** Easily add and arrange nodes on the canvas.
- **Dynamic Connections:** Link boxes to define data flow.
- **Multiple Node Types:** Input, Output, JSON, Gmail, and more.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Changes in one box reflect dynamically in connected nodes.
- **Customizable:** Add your own node types and behavior.

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-flow-app.git
   cd react-flow-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Usage

1. Drag boxes (nodes) from the toolbar onto the canvas.
2. Connect nodes by clicking and dragging from one node's output port to another node's input port.
3. Configure the nodes by clicking on them and editing their properties in the side panel.
4. Observe real-time data flow and updates across connected nodes.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** Core library for building the UI.
- **React Flow:** For creating and managing the node-based flow.
- **TailwindCSS:** For styling the application.
- **Node.js:** Backend for handling any additional data processing (if applicable).

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for saving and loading workflows.
- Integrate with external APIs for advanced node types.
- Implement user authentication and cloud storage for workflows.
